# MCP Documentation Servers

Always consult MCP servers before relying on training data for these topics:

## openaiDeveloperDocs
Use for: GPT models, Responses API, function calling, agents, tools, embeddings, streaming, Codex, pricing, rate limits, or any OpenAI API question.

## shadcn
Use for: shadcn/ui components, props, variants, installation, registry, theming, or any UI component question related to this project.

## Vercel (already active)
Use for: deployments, domains, serverless functions, environment variables, build config, or any Vercel platform question.
